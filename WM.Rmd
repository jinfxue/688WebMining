## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
url <- "https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/timeline-of-20th-and-21st-century-wars"
timeline <- url %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes(css = 'strong')%>%
  html_text() 
#timeline <- filter(timeline !="-" & "-19")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
